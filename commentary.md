Hyginus, chapter 30, section 1

*Capitoline Museum, Inv. Scu. 247*

"dracones duos duabus manibus necauit / he killed two snakes with his two heads" The sculpture only showed that he killed one sake with one hand.

Hyginus, chapter 30, sections 4-6

"aprum Erymanthium occidit. / He killed the Erythium boar." Hercules was holding a boar. Either he was killing it or he has killed it already.

The drawing showed the stag "cum cornibus aureis / with golden horns" .

The drawing showed that "quae emissis pennis suis iaculabantur / who were shooting their feathers being sent out" by highlighting the birds' feathers in white.
