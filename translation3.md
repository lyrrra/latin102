C. Literary commentary
Choose two choices of syntax, word order, or diction that Hyginus makes in this passage that complement or enhance the meaning of the passageâ€™s content. Discuss briefly s in 3-4 sentences. Italicize Latin words when citing them.

*cum Abdero famulo interfecit* means Hercules killed Diomenes and his four horses with Abderos, but not Abderos ate human flesh with Diomenes and the horses. *Abdero famulo* is in the dative case.

Hyginus put the object first, eliminated the subject Hercules, and added the person who helped Hercules near the verb, like *maiorem partem Iove adiutore*.

Translation:

He cleaned the manure of stall of King Augeas one day, with greater part of help from Jupiter. He washed all the manure away, letting go a river.

He led up the bull, with whom Pasiphae had sex with from island Crete to Mycenes, alive.

With salve Abderos he killed Diomenes, king of Thrace, and his four hourses, who ate human flesh. Moreover, the horses' names were Podargus, Lampon, Xanthus, and Dinus.
